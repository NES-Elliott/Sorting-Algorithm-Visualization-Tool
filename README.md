# Merge Sort Visualizer

There are many ways to sort data, especially numerical data. Depending on the type of data you receive, some sorting methods are faster. This **Sorting Visualizer Tool** was made as a way to visually see how and at what speed a selected algorithm could sort the data you give it. This application was created using the `create-react-app` bootstrap.

## How To Use
---

An array will generate upon startup.

When the algorithm is finished sorting, you can generate a new array to watch it again.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository over to your device.

2. In your terminal, navigate into the Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization-Tool directory and type `npm install`.

3. Use `npm start` to start the app or alternatively you can head over to [Sorting Visualizer](https://nes-elliott.github.io/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization-Tool/) on Heroku.

### Future Additons

In the future, I'd like to expand the algorithm selection to include options like quick sort, heap sort, and bubble sort.
